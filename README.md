# 🎬 Movies Recommendation System Analysis & Prediction ML Project

Welcome to the Movies Recommendation System project! 🎉 This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a movie recommendation system using Python and Machine Learning.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The project focuses on building a **movie recommendation system** using **Machine Learning algorithms** to predict and recommend movies based on users' preferences and features of movies.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📊  
  - Performed deep analysis of the dataset to understand patterns and trends in movie ratings, genres, and user preferences.

- **Feature Engineering** 🔧  
  - Extracted meaningful features and performed data transformation techniques to improve model performance.

- **Machine Learning Model** 🤖  
  - Built and trained multiple machine learning models, including collaborative filtering and content-based approaches, to predict movie ratings and recommend movies to users.

- **Model Evaluation** 📈  
  - Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and other performance indicators to ensure the best recommendations.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Libraries:**  
  - **Pandas** 📊 (Data analysis)
  - **NumPy** 🔢 (Mathematical operations)
  - **Scikit-learn** 🧑‍💻 (Machine Learning models)
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn** 📉 (Data visualization)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and some libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishekkumar62000/Movies-Recommendation-System-Anlysis-Prediction-ML-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movies-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to explore the project.

### 📝 EDA Process

- Analyzed dataset for missing values, outliers, and correlations.
- Visualized data trends using charts like histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.

### 🔧 Feature Engineering

- Created new features like movie genre, average ratings, and user preferences.
- Applied techniques like **One-Hot Encoding** and **Normalization** for improved data handling.

### 🧑‍💻 Building the ML Model

- Implemented **Collaborative Filtering** for user-based and item-based recommendation.
- Used **Content-Based Filtering** based on movie attributes like genres and actors.
- Employed **KNN**, **SVD**, and **Decision Trees** for predictions.

### 📊 Model Evaluation

- Compared model performances using RMSE and MAE.
- Fine-tuned models for better prediction accuracy.
- 

## 🔑 Highlights

- 🌟 **Personalized movie recommendations** based on user preferences.
- 📈 **Data-driven approach** with advanced machine learning techniques.
- 🎥 **Interactive user experience** by predicting top movie choices.
